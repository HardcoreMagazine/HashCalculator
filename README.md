# Universal hash calculator

Simple console utility to calculate file SHA-256, SHA-1, MD5 hash sums. 
This program was designed for big files (0.5~1 GB+) which could not be uploaded on cloud/web hashsum calculators.
> NOTE:
> if compared to cloud/web or others - SHA-1, SHA-256 hashes may not match due to changes being made in file after upload / encodings used.
